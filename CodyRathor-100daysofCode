During My 100 days of code challenge I will be attempting to complete the entire FreeCodeCamp curriculum!

Day 1 - Jan.31, 2018:
    Worked On FreeCodeCamp sections 183 to 202. Learned about Arrays, Objects and the Math.Random() function.

Day 2 - Feb.1, 2018:
  FreeCodeCamp sections 202 to 223. Learned more about Arrays, specifically functions like :
  - split, reduce, filter, sort, reverse, concat, join, and map.
  also went through regular expressions. (Still need to read more on them to understand more).
  I have now started the section of algorithm challenges!

Day 3 - Feb.2, 2018:
    FreeCodeCamp sections 223 to 232. Completed more of the challenges, currently stuck on checking whether all characters of one array index exist in another. I am more stuck on words that are in reverse. (perhaps i will have to reverse or sort).

Day 4 - Feb.3, 2018:
    FreeCodeCamp sections 232 to 240. Finished the algorithm challenge and started the section on JSON and ajax requests using jQuery.

Day 5 - Feb.4, 2018:
    FreeCodeCamp sections 240 to 247. Finished the JSON section and move on the the first intermediate project, the random quote generator. Still need to figure out how to escape some characters when passing them to twitter API! Other than that the project was completed today!

Day 6 - Feb.5, 2018:
    FreeCodeCamp sections 247 to 257. Finished the Weather App Project. On to the Wikipedia Viewer. Learned a great deal about setting elements based on API calls. very good challenge for getting the data you want to display how and when you want it to!!. Awesome challenge looking forward to them becoming more and more challenging.

Day 7 - Feb.6, 2018:
    FreeCodeCamp section 257. Worked on the Wikipedia Viewer project. have the css completed and all the functions set up. did some reading on CORS and attempted to get a succesful API request with no success. Keeping my head up there is always another day.

Day 8 - Feb.7th, 2018:
    FreeCodeCamp section 257. Finished the Wikipedia Viewer project. Figured out how to setup CORS and pull in the data required to complete the challenge. I decided to do the challenge in React to get more practice and keep my existing knowledge of it relevant. Now onto the TwitchTV JSON API challenge. Will also attempt to complete it in React :)

Day 9 - Feb.8th, 2018:
    FreeCodeCamp section 258. Started working on the TwitchTv Project. I decided to add more than what is required functionally so that I could push myself a little further to gain more knowledge and understanding. Got the app pulling all the data I need, now I am excited to style it all!

Day 10 - Feb.9th, 2018:
    FreeCodeCamp section 258. Found out I had programmed some functions against the standards of React. Started reading more documentation on componentDidMount as well as other built in methods. Have to redo some of the code in order to correct the issue. Got most of the styling done. just have to propgram an online-offline status signal and add the functionality for showing Online only, Offline only and All.
