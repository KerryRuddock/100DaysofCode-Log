During My 100 days of code challenge I will be attempting to complete the entire FreeCodeCamp curriculum!

Day 1: Worked On FreeCodeCamp sections 183 to 202. Learned about Arrays, Objects and the Math.Random() function.

Day 2: FreeCodeCamp sections 202 to 223. Learned more about Arrays, specifically functions like :
  - split, reduce, filter, sort, reverse, concat, join, and map.
  also went through regular expressions. (Still need to read more on them to understand more).
  I have now started the section of algorithm challenges!
